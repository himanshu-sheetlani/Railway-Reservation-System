# Railway Reservation System

A simple C++ project that allows users to:
- Book railway tickets
- View booked tickets
- Cancel tickets

Passenger details are stored in a text file to ensure data persistence. This project is a great way to practice file handling, classes, and object-oriented programming concepts in C++.
